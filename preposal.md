# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

The idea I have for my final project is a web-based application based on my friend's Gia art business called 528 HOTTIE. Based in New York, she uses the natural artistic skills she has and refined in the art school we both attended and met (art and design high school) to create fun, fantastical press-ons, and nail art for people who want to see their imagination come to life that they may not get at a local nail salon. She drafts inspirations from songs, music videos, movies, and her own mood boards to create something very special for her customers. I have been interested in creating a website on her behalf since last year and already drafted a repository on Git Hub, but haven't done more than post some assets. I want to take the opportunity of this in-class project to finish a project I had intended to start a few months ago.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

no

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I personally use vscode. I have a question on how to organize pieces of code and the assets within GitHub and just my regular folder. not too sure about what I'm asking but how do I work beyond building the homepage for my project and also have it linked inside my homepage? for instance, how do I make it flow from the loading page to the homepage, to about me, to contact, etc? 


here is my GitHub link of what I have from a few months ago: https://github.com/heyvinyls/528hottiehz-mock
